# ediSON

## What is ediSON?
##### A glorified JSON text editor. A J<ins>SON</ins> <ins>edi</ins>tor.
JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a format that has widespread use in various technologies, most notably, the web. Our project is an editor for JSON files written in C so that users can edit, parse, and serialize JSON files with ease.

## How did we make it?
### Topics used:
* Files - Reading, Parsing, and Serializing to/from files.
* Memory Allocation - Allocating memory to represent JSON at runtime
* File stats - Displaying useful information such as last modified time, and file size.
* Signals - CLI Editor should ask to save before exiting, and be able to intercept other signals gracefully.
