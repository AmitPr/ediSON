# ediSON
###### *by Carlos Hernandez, Eisuke Hirota, Amit Prasad, Period 10*

## What is ediSON?
##### A glorified JSON text editor. A J"SON" "edi"tor. (add more)

## How did we make it?
### Topics used:
* Files - Reading, Parsing, and Serializing to/from files.
* Memory Allocation - Allocating memory to represent JSON at runtime
* File stats - Displaying useful information such as last modified time, and file size.
* Signals - CLI Editor should ask to save before exiting, and be able to intercept other signals gracefully.
